        <p>So pumped to have the opportunity to be in this program at Galvanize. I am
        ready to succeed and make new friends that will practically become family. At the moment
        I am looking towards working for a startup company. Although I am keeping all of my options
        open and looking forward for potential great opportunities. I love it here in Colorado being so close to family, but I have always had the dream of living on the West Coast for a bit.</p>
